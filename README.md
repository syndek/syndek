## Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Louis, I'm a software developer living in London and a big believer in open source. I learnt a lot of what I know from looking through other people's code!

I'm currently working at [Radical Company](https://www.radicalcompany.com), doing backend work across a number of different projects. Most of this is being done with C#/ASP.NET at the moment, but I'm looking to pick up other technologies in the future.
